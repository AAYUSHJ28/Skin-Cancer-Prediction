# Skin Cancer Prediction

This project implements a machine learning model for predicting various types of skin cancer using image data. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to classify skin lesions into different categories using a deep learning model. The notebook utilizes the following steps:

1. Data Loading: Prepares a dataset of images and their labels.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes the class distribution and samples of the dataset.

3. Data Preprocessing: Applies techniques such as augmentation, encoding, and normalization.

4. Model Training: Builds and trains a convolutional neural network (CNN).

5. Model Evaluation: Evaluates performance using confusion matrices, classification reports, and ROC curves.

## Features

* Data Visualization: Explore class distributions and sample images.

* Modeling: Train a CNN using Keras and TensorFlow.

* Performance Metrics: Evaluate results using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrices, and AUC-ROC curves.

## Results

### Key Metrics

1. Confusion Matrix: Displays predicted versus true labels for each class.

2. Classification Report: Provides precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.

3. ROC Curve: Visualizes the model's ability to distinguish between classes.

## Sample Outputs

* Class Distribution:
Visual representation of the number of samples per class.

* Predicted Images:
Randomly selected test images with predictions.
